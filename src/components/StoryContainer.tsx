                In a quiet corner of <span className="highlight-text">Tamil Nadu</span>, 
                wrapped in dusty fields, stubborn coconut trees, and slow-moving cattle, 
                a small boy used to sit cross-legged on the cement floor of a modest house. 
                No laptop, no mobile phone, no WiFi. Just a <span className="highlight-text">cracked old radio</span>, 
                humming and crackling like it had a heartbeat of its own.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">That boy — was me.</p>

                Every evening, right before sunset, while my mother prepared dinner 
                and the smell of tamarind rice filled the house, I tuned in. The voice 
                on the radio wasn't just giving weather updates — it was doing 
                <span className="highlight-text">magic</span>. "Chance of rainfall tomorrow," 
                it would say. And most of the time... it came true.

                I ran with that question to everyone I knew — my teachers, my parents, 
                even the old librarian with thick glasses and a thicker accent. But no 
                one could explain it. They shrugged. Some smiled and said it was just 
                "technology." But that wasn't enough for me.

                <span className="highlight-text">instincts, gossips from neighbours, and that one old radio</span>. 
                But to me, it was more than enough. It became my first classroom. 
                That radio didn't just broadcast sound — it 
                <span className="highlight-text">planted a dream</span> inside me.

            Dreams in a Dusty Notebook

                They say, "<span className="highlight-text">Don't judge a student by his slippers</span>." 
                And trust me, if you saw me back in school, you'd probably think that statement was

                I'd walk into school with worn-out chappals, an oversized shirt that had been passed 
                down from my brother (which, let's face it, swallowed me whole), and a bag that had 
                been stitched more times than I could count. The seams were like lifelines, holding together 
                the moments when I felt like giving up. No one would've looked at me and thought, "Oh, here's 
                a future AI engineer." But inside that dusty notebook, I was scribbling dreams — <span className="highlight-text">dreams that stretched 
                far beyond the boundaries of my time</span>.

                I loved school — not because it was easy, but because it was a 
                <span className="highlight-text">battle</span>. And I was ready to fight.

                The first time I topped my class, people clapped, and I thought, "This is it." But the second time? People 
                whispered, "Maybe he got lucky."

                Those whispers were like tiny daggers. But they couldn't stop me. I wasn't lucky. 
                I was <span className="highlight-text">silent in my work</span> — burning the midnight 
                oil when no one was watching, battling the doubts when no one was looking at me.

                By the time I reached my 10th grade, I scored <span className="highlight-text">91%</span>. 
                Suddenly, the whispers stopped, and the world couldn't deny me anymore. I wasn't lucky; 
                I was <span className="highlight-text">driven</span>. I had this quiet fire inside me, 
                one that no one could see — but I felt it, every single day.

                But then came high school, and with it came a drop in my marks. From a shining 91%, 
                I plummeted to 71%. That hurt. It wasn't just a number — it was a 
                <span className="highlight-text">blow to my pride</span>. People who used to call me "the topper" 
                were now calling me "the fallen star." Some even whispered, "He peaked too early."

                It was a hard pill to swallow, especially when I was used to being at the top. But that moment — 
                that fall — is what made me who I am today. It taught me a lesson that still drives me:

              <p>
                The shame I felt? It wasn't my weakness. It was my <span className="highlight-text">fuel</span>. 
                I couldn't hide behind excuses, and I wasn't going to let that shame define me. Instead of 
                crumbling under the weight of disappointment, I found the strength to write this down in my diary:
              </p>

            <StorySection>
              <p>
                That single line became my <span className="highlight-text">mantra</span>, my guiding light 
                when I couldn't see the road ahead. It was a promise I made to myself: 
                "I may not be brilliant, but I will always be hungry." And hunger, I realized, 
                always beats talent when talent sleeps.

                Even during that phase, when everything seemed bleak and the world didn't believe in me, 
                I'd look up at the stars. And I'd tell myself, "There's something out there, waiting for me. 
                I may not know what it is, but I can feel it. I'm meant for something more."

              <p>
                People might've thought it was delusion. But it wasn't. It was my only light, shining in 
                the dark. As the old proverb goes, "Fall seven times, stand up eight." I'd fallen once. 
                But trust me when I say, I wasn't done standing yet. Not by a long shot.

                Stepping into the gates of SECC, Anna University, I wasn't just carrying notebooks — 
                I was carrying expectations, doubts, and one wild dream. The world of 
                <span className="highlight-text">Electrical and Electronics Engineering</span> looked 
                massive, and honestly, I felt small.

              <p>
                In those early days, everything felt unfamiliar. The lectures were fast, the equations wild, 
                and the classmates... sharp. Coding platforms were buzzing across campus, and I barely knew 
                how to print "Hello World." But I had a mantra:
              </p>

            <StorySection>
              <p>
                So I hustled. I started picking up logic, writing code, solving problems — failing more than 
                winning, but always learning. Eventually, I earned my spot in the 
                <span className="highlight-text">top 10% of coders in my college</span> on the official 
                platform. No one gave it to me. I earned it line by line, bug by bug.

            <StorySection>
              <p>
                At the same time, I was getting my hands dirty — literally. In the college workshop, I was 
                part of a team that worked on <span className="highlight-text">retrofitting the iconic 
                Ambassador car into an electric vehicle</span>. It wasn't a textbook assignment. It was 
                real hardware, real voltage, real risk — and real pride. That project made me feel like an 
                innovator, not just a student.

              <p>
                Then came another milestone: the <span className="highlight-text">industrial project at 
                Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC)</span>. I found myself inside one of India's largest 
                thermal power plants, surrounded by control systems, real-time data, and a new sense of 
                seriousness. The environment was intense — no room for textbook answers, only 
                <span className="highlight-text">real-time thinking</span>. That was the moment I saw how 
                data and logic could move machines — and people.

              <p>
                Outside the labs and classrooms, I kept exploring. I joined hackathons, tech workshops, 
                and collected a trail of certificates like puzzle pieces of my future self. Every event, 
                every bug I fixed, every sleepless night debugging — it all 
                <span className="highlight-text">molded my mindset</span>.

                Not because it was the easiest. But because it matched my dream: blending hardware, software, data, and 
                AI into something big. Something mine.
